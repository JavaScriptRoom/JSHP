# JSHP
JavaScript Hypertext Processing - Bringing the awesomeness of PHP to inferior languages like JavaScript since 1870

## Getting started

- clone repo
- run `npm install`
- run `./start &`

That's it!

You can place your files in the folder itself (nested folders supported!) as `foo.js`, and use the `echo` function to send markup to client.
No need to restart server or anything after making edits to file. `/` is matched by the `index.js` file ofcourse, just like the corresponding part in PHP!

Browse to `localhost:8080/<fileName>.js` to see your code working.

More features to come soon like `$_GET` and `$_POST` etc. Remember to come join us in the JS room at http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/17/javascript.
